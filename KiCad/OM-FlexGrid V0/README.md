## 🛠️ How It Works

The 74HC4067 connects one column at a time to 3.3V. The Velostat pads act as pressure-sensitive resistors connected to row lines, which are pulled down with 10kΩ resistors and read via analog inputs.

A software loop cycles through all 15 columns, sampling all 4 rows each time for 60 total readings per frame.
