## üéØ Your Project in 30 Seconds

**The Vision:**
A wristband that reads muscle activity to detect hand gestures, enabling silent control of AI services and smart devices. Instead of "Hey AI, turn on the light," you simply point and the light responds.

**The Tech:**
- 60-channel EMG sensor array detects muscle movements
- 6-axis IMU tracks arm orientation
- On-device ML model recognizes 8-12 gestures
- Bluetooth LE broadcasts to bridge device
- MCP/ChatGPT interprets context and executes actions

**The Impact:**
- ü§´ Privacy (no always-listening microphones)
- ‚ö° Speed (faster than voice commands)
- ‚ôø Accessibility (for people who can't/won't speak)
- üéØ Precision (point at exactly what you want)

**The Demo:**
1. Point at ceiling light ‚Üí turns on
2. Fist gesture ‚Üí calls Uber
3. Twist wrist ‚Üí unlocks door
4. All without saying a word!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls (Avoid These!)

### ‚ùå Don't Do This

1. **Over-engineer early**
   - Don't spend 10 hours optimizing ML for 2% gain
   - Don't implement 20 gestures when 8 will do

2. **Ignore the demo**
   - Don't code for 35 hours then scramble to demo
   - Don't assume "it'll work when we present"

3. **Perfectionism**
   - Don't aim for 99% accuracy when 85% is impressive
   - Don't rewrite code that already works

4. **Poor time management**
   - Don't spend all time on hardware and ignore software
   - Don't leave integration to the last minute

5. **No backup plan**
   - Don't rely on live WiFi/internet
   - Don't have only one demo scenario

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead

1. **Get core working fast**
   - Working end-to-end by hour 12
   - Then iterate and improve

2. **Test demo early and often**
   - Test full demo flow by hour 20
   - Run through presentation 10+ times

3. **Embrace "good enough"**
   - 85% accuracy + great demo > 95% accuracy + no demo
   - Working prototype > perfect code

4. **Timebox everything**
   - If something takes >2 hours, ask for help or pivot
   - Use timers for each phase

5. **Multiple fallbacks**
   - Backup video of successful demo
   - Demo on laptop if projector fails
   - Simulated devices if APIs fail
